The name is all that remains of a delivery empire that once promised everything, everywhere, in two days. A thousand years later, the Two-Day Promise is a religious covenant. Congo doesn’t just extract from rifts — they warehouse, catalog, distribute, and deliver. The rift is a supply chain. Everything is a supply chain. <strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Brown and gold. Warehouses the size of cities. Sorting facilities that never close. The arrow logo — once a simple brand mark — has become a sacred geometry. It points forward. Always forward. Citizens wear it over their hearts. <strong>Citizen Identity:</strong> Fulfillers. Every citizen is part of the chain — picking, packing, shipping, delivering. Not metaphorically. The caste system is literally organized by fulfillment role. Pickers harvest. Packers process. Shippers transport. Deliverers are the warrior-clergy who ensure goods reach their destination. The Founder — a figure of mythic proportions, bald and laughing, ascending to the stars on a pillar of fire — is worshipped as the First Deliverer."

Congo’s rift operations are industrial-scale extraction with logistics precision. They don’t just mine the rift — they’ve built sorting facilities on the other side. Forward operating warehouses in other dimensions. The supply chain extends through reality itself."

Briefings are automated — you receive a manifest, a route, and a deadline. Meet the deadline, get paid. Miss it, get docked. Congo doesn’t hate you. Congo doesn’t think about you. You’re a line on a spreadsheet that either resolves green or red."
