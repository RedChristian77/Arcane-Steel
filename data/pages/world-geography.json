The other half is dead zone — land so saturated with ambient toxicity that unprotected human life can’t sustain itself for more than a few days. The dead zones aren’t uniform. Some are barren wasteland where nothing grows. Some are overgrown with rift-touched flora that would be beautiful if it weren’t lethal. Some are just <em>wrong</em> — places where dimensional bleed has warped physics enough that water flows uphill, light bends the wrong way, or time moves at a rate that doesn’t match the rest of the world."

Humans have adapted over a millennium (baseline toxicity tolerance is higher than it was), and corporate water treatment, air filtration, and food processing keep ambient exposure manageable in populated areas. Step outside a city’s infrastructure, though, and the numbers climb. The further from civilization, the worse it gets."

The wealthiest control gate clusters — three or four rifts in close proximity, each leading to a different dimension, producing different resources. Gate clusters are strategic assets worth fighting wars over. Wars have been fought over them."

Congo figured this out centuries ago."

Control the gates, control the route, control the trade. The Char is the most common shortcut (hot, hostile, but distances compress well). The Grave offers premium low-toxicity corridors cleared of Remnants. The Bloom is impossible — track overgrows in hours. The Static would rearrange the rails. The Mirror is classified."
