      "text": "<em>Session Structure:</em>  • Contracts are chosen, not assigned. The crew has enough reputation to pick their jobs. The question shifts from “can we afford to take this?“ to “should we take this?“  • Downtime includes strategic planning — the crew is managing a base, relationships, and a growing crisis simultaneously  • Multi-session arcs: a single objective might take 3-5 sessions to resolve  • The subplot from Act 2 becomes the main plot  <em>GM Goals for Act 3:</em>  • Threaten what they built. The base is targeted. A key NPC is in danger. Their corp patron demands something unconscionable. A rift opens near their margin. Make the stakes personal and concrete.  • Force meaningful choices. Not “do you fight or run“ but “do you protect the base or pursue the lead? Do you honor the corp contract or help the settlement? Do you stay together or split the crew for two simultaneous objectives?“  • Raise the threat tier. T3-T4 enemies. Boss encounters. Rift zones that push into Orange or Red classification. The combat gets dangerous enough that preparation matters.  • The money spiral doesn’t stop. Even during the climactic arc, rent is still due. Scars still need treatment. The economic engine keeps running underneath the drama. The crew can’t just heroically charge into danger — they have to budget for it.  • Give them a reason to care beyond survival. Not every campaign needs to save the world. Most shouldn’t. But the crew should care about something — their base, their margin, their NPCs, their piece of the world. Protecting that is enough.  <em>Contract Types for Act 3:</em>  • Self-directed missions (the crew defines the objective)  • Corp-conflict operations (the crew is caught between corps)  • Deep rift expeditions (Red/Black Zone, multi-session, expedition-scale)  • Defense of home territory (the margin, the base, the settlement)  • The climactic contract — the one that resolves the main thread  <em>Expected Crew State by End of Act 3:</em>  • 5-7 scars each (veterans)  • Near or at tree mastery (8-10 augments)  • Fully developed base with multiple rooms and upgrades  • A vehicle (probably upgraded or replaced with rift-rated)  • Known by name in their margin and beyond  • Something resolved — or at least survived"
