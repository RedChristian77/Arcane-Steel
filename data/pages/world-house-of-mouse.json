A thousand years later, the stories are scripture, the characters are saints, and the imagined worlds are blueprints for the real ones. The House of Mouse doesn't just own intellectual property — it IS intellectual property. Every creature design, every magical technique, every dimensional discovery made under the House's banner belongs to the House. Forever. Across all dimensions. Including ones that haven't been discovered yet. The legal framework for cross-dimensional IP was established six centuries ago and has never been successfully challenged, because challenging it requires surviving the legal department, and nobody survives the legal department."

The catch: your contract includes IP clauses that assign everything you discover, create, or even <em>think of</em> during the contract period to the House. Technically, the interesting thought you had about rift topology while eating lunch is now House property. Enforcement of this clause is selective but not theoretical. An Advocate once filed a claim against a contractor's dream journal. The Advocate won."

The equipment is elegant, well-designed, and embossed with the House sigil. The handlers are friendly, supportive, and watching you with the focused attention of people evaluating whether you're on-brand. You will sign more documents than any other corp. You will understand fewer of them. The food is themed. The lodging is themed. The mandatory team-building exercises are themed. At some point you'll realize that the entire experience has been designed to make you feel something specific, and that the feeling was planned before you arrived."
