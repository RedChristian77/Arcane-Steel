They’re the things a veteran contractor knows how to do that a rookie doesn’t. Abilities don’t deal direct damage. They amplify, modify, apply conditions, buff allies, debuff enemies, and create tactical opportunities. The weapon deals the damage. The ability changes the context."

Abilities change <em>how</em> damage lands.  • <strong>Mix of passive and active.</strong> Passives are always-on instincts. Actives cost AP and produce effects, not damage.  • <strong>Pay to grow.</strong> Every ability is purchased with credits and requires training time (downtime activity). Find an instructor, pay their fee, spend downtime learning.  • <strong>Wide, not deep.</strong> Each tier offers 5-6 options. Players pick 1 for free, can buy additional picks at double cost. A contractor who dumps credits into training has a LOT to choose from.  • <strong>Kit-specific but not kit-locked.</strong> Cross-training into other kit trees costs triple credits and requires T3+ in your own tree first."
